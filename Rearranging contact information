--- Method 1 - CASE WHEN with MAX
SELECT	CustomerID,
		MAX(CASE WHEN Type IN ('Emergency') THEN PhoneNumber ELSE NULL END) AS Emergency,
		MAX(CASE WHEN Type IN ('Mobile') THEN PhoneNumber ELSE NULL END) AS Mobile,
		MAX(CASE WHEN Type IN ('Personal') THEN PhoneNumber ELSE NULL END) AS Personal
FROM	#ContactInfo
GROUP BY CustomerID;

--- Method 2 - Using CTEs and JOINs
WITH cte_Emergency AS
(SELECT  CustomerID, PhoneNumber AS Emergency
FROM    #ContactInfo
WHERE   [Type] = 'Emergency'),

cte_Mobile AS
(SELECT  CustomerID, PhoneNumber AS Mobile
FROM    #ContactInfo
WHERE   [Type] = 'Mobile'),

cte_Personal AS
(SELECT  CustomerID, PhoneNumber AS Personal
FROM    #ContactInfo
WHERE   [Type] = 'Personal')

SELECT  a.CustomerID,
        b.Emergency,
        c.Mobile,
        d.Personal
FROM    (SELECT DISTINCT CustomerID FROM #ContactInfo) a LEFT OUTER JOIN
        cte_Emergency b ON a.CustomerID = b.CustomerID LEFT OUTER JOIN
        cte_Mobile c ON a.CustomerID = c.CustomerID LEFT OUTER JOIN
        cte_Personal d ON a.CustomerID = d.CustomerID;

--- Method 3 - Inbuilt PIVOT-UNPIVOT feature
SELECT CustomerID,[Emergency],[Mobile],[Personal] 
FROM #ContactInfo PIVOT (MAX(PhoneNumber) FOR [Type] IN ([Emergency],[Mobile],[Personal])) AS PivotClause;
